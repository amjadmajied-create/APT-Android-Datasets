This dataset contains Android device behavior data collected from a physical device to support the detection of multi-stage Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) attacks. It includes resource usage features (CPU, RAM, battery, RX, TX, traffic) and app-level features (permissions, sensors, services), covering multiple APT stages such as Initial Compromise, Credential Access / Privilege Escalation, and Exfiltration.
